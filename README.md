# Srijith Reddy | Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m **Srijith Reddy**, a data science enthusiast currently exploring the intersection of statistics, optimization, and machine learning. This site showcases three major projects completed as part of the graduate course **STA 9890: Statistical Learning for Data Mining** at Baruch College.

Each project reflects a thoughtful blend of statistical theory and practical modeling for real-world challenges.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 🏠 [Property Valuation Modeling](https://srijith-reddy.github.io/Statistical-Learning-for-Data-Mining-Projects/project3.html)
- **Goal**: Predict 2019 assessed property values using historical real estate and protest data.
- **Techniques**: Ridge Regression, LightGBM, XGBoost.
- **Highlights**:
  - Extensive feature engineering with SHAP-based selection.
  - Ensemble stacking yielded **RMSE ≈ 36K** on test set.

### 🏀 [Fair NBA Draft Predictor](https://srijith-reddy.github.io/Statistical-Learning-for-Data-Mining-Projects/project2.html)
- **Goal**: Build a fairness-aware model for NBA draft predictions.
- **Approach**: Ensemble of Naive Bayes, LDA, SVM, and penalized logistic regressions.
- **Innovation**:
  - Introduced **FairStacks** to minimize TPR gap across school tiers.

### 📈 [Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Ridge Regression](https://srijith-reddy.github.io/Statistical-Learning-for-Data-Mining-Projects/project1.html)
- **Goal**: Compare Ridge vs. OLS under linear and nonlinear settings.
- **Method**: Simulation-based analysis of bias and variance.
- **Outcome**:
  - Visualized when regularization improves generalization.
