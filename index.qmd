# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Srijith Reddy**, a data science enthusiast currently exploring the intersection of statistics, optimization, and machine learning. This portfolio showcases three major projects from my *Statistical Learning for Data Mining* course—each grounded in rigorous modeling, evaluation, and interpretation. These projects reflect not just applied techniques, but a careful balance between theory and performance.

##  Featured Projects

### [Property Valuation Modeling](project3.qmd)
Used Ridge Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost to predict 2019 assessed property values from structured historical real estate data. Extensive feature engineering (including SHAP-based selection) and ensemble stacking yielded an RMSE of ~36K on the test set.

### [Fair NBA Draft Predictor](project2.qmd)
Developed a fairness-aware ensemble model (FairStacks) to predict NBA draft selection probabilities. Trained base models like Naive Bayes, LDA, SVM, and penalized logistic regressions, while optimizing a fairness-constrained loss to reduce TPR gap across school tiers.

### [Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Ridge Regression](project1.qmd)
Simulated performance of Ridge vs OLS across linear and nonlinear data-generating processes. Illustrated the bias-variance decomposition with clean visualizations to explain when and why Ridge outperforms OLS under regularization.

## About the Course

These projects were completed as part of *STA 9890: Statistical Learning for Data Mining*—a graduate-level course emphasizing predictive modeling, generalization error, model interpretability, and hands-on experimentation. The coursework combined theoretical insights with real-world data challenges.
